# Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration Template
# Copy this file to cloudflared-config.yml and update with your tunnel ID

tunnel: <TUNNEL_ID>
# IMPORTANT (Windows): cloudflared typically stores tunnel credentials in your
# user profile/AppData (not inside this repo). If you omit `credentials-file`,
# cloudflared will look in its default location for:
#   <tunnel-id>.json

ingress:
  # Route all traffic to your local Next.js server
  - hostname: DH.nicholasching.ca
    service: http://localhost:3000
  
  # Catch-all rule (must be last)
  - service: http_status:404
